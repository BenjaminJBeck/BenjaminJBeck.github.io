I know you’ve blocked me on everything, and I respect that choice — I won’t try to reach out again beyond this. Still, there are things on my heart that I just needed to put into words, even if you never read them.

I’ve come to understand that no matter what I say, I can’t change how you feel toward me — and that’s something I’m learning to accept. That doesn’t make it any less true that you meant a lot to me.

When we first got close — the late-night calls, the daily texts — I began to feel something I hadn’t felt before: hope. I’ve always struggled when it comes to dating, and while I technically had someone before you, it never felt real. With you, it did. I genuinely thought the world of you, and I would’ve gladly driven those six hours just for a chance to see you in person.

In September, I made one of the biggest mistakes of my life by letting our connection fade while I was seeing someone else. When that ended and I realized I couldn’t reach out to you anymore, it wasn’t just losing the chance to talk — it was losing a friend I deeply valued. Even though we never met in person, we shared something meaningful. And when you came back but wanted nothing to do with me, I was overwhelmed with regret.

I know now that part of why I missed you so much wasn’t just you as a person, but the hope and happiness I had when we were close. Before you, I didn’t believe love — real, honest love — was possible for me. And after losing you, that hopelessness started to creep back in.

Even though I’ve dated since then, nothing has changed that feeling. Something inside me felt like it broke after December, and I haven’t figured out how to get it back. I think that’s part of why I’ve held onto you so tightly — not to possess you, but because I missed the light you brought into my life.

I understand you never want to see or hear from me again, and I will do my best to let go. But still, I want you to know I genuinely wish you happiness. If life ever brings you to a place where you need a friend — someone who truly cares — I’ll always be here.

Take care of yourself, Greenbean. You deserve the world.")
